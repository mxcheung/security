 Security Misconfiguration
Insecure coding practices or improper handling of data could lead to inadvertent exposure of pipe-delimited values. For example:

Misuse in Logs: If the data is logged without sanitizing the pipe symbol, it could expose sensitive data or cause misinterpretation of logs.
Security Systems: Intrusion detection or prevention systems might incorrectly interpret pipe symbols in log files or transmitted data as part of a potential attack.
